Its stages of evolution are marked by three great docu­ments, Lombard  Street, the  Macmillan  Report,  and  the  Radcliffe Report. Each of these arose out of the accumulated concern with the progress of events in the world.  Each represented a search for answers  to urgent questions  of its  day</p><p>The reports deal largely with the adjustments and modifications of British central banking to external difficulties and problems. The Macmillan Report appeared as the world crumbled into the depres­ sion of the 1930’s. TTie Radcliffe Report of 1959 appeared in an epoch of shaky alliances ai.d emerging trading blocs. Both followed a period of inflation and international readjustment after the holocaust of war. It was in the aftermath of war also that emerging capitalism and deposit banking fell into the difficulties which led to the production of the greatest of the documents, Lombard Street. Priority in time gave it the task, not of suggesting necessary modifications in central banking, but the more vital one, of enumerating the prime func­ tions of a central bank. It created the concept of a central bank and thereby has for all time assured to its author a secure position in bank­ ing thought.</p><p>The Macmillan and Radcliffe studies are the works of many men who had staffs and the benefit of much data. Lombard Street is the product of only one man, Walter Bagehot, and as such reflects his deep understanding and intimate knowledge of banking, business and fiscal affairs. Its ideas were first expressed in a series of articles in The Economist during the 1850’s and were put into book form in 1870. During his relatively short lifetime (1826-1877) Bagehot wrote extensively on a wide range of literary, political, and economic sub­ jects. His collected works run into five substantial volumes. While obviously a many faceted man, his main interests lay in the broad field of political economy and his chief occupation was that of editor of The Economist, the world’s most influential financial paper.</p><p>During his  relatively short lifetime  (1826-1877)  Bagehot  wrote 
extensively on a wide range of literary, political, and economic sub­
jects.  His collected works run into five substantial volumes.  While 
obviously a many faceted man, his main interests lay in the broad field 
of political economy and his chief occupation was that of editor of 
The Economist
, the world’s most influential financial paper.</p><p>Bagehot was born into a banking family and succeeded his father 
as vice chairman of Stuckey’s Banking Co. of Langport,  Somerset. He represented the bank in the “Gty”  (i.e., London’s financial dis­
trict.)  Although he was educated as a lawyer, literary and financial 
matters were more attractive to him than was the law.  It was through 
his interest in free trade that he met James Wilson, the editor and 
owner  of 
The  Economist. This  encounter  led  to  his  marriage  to 
Wilson’s  daughter,  Eliza.  When Wilson  died  while  serving  on  a 
governmental mission in India, Bagehot became editor of the paper.</p><p>He was the ideal editor for this journal.  His  brilliance  and  his 
writing style, which, like his conversation, was challenging, provoca­
tive, and yet often amusing, aided the growth of 
The Economist’s
 cir­
culation.  Descriptions of Bagehot by his contemporaries abound with 
the adjectives “alert,” “sagacious,” “speculative,” and “witty.”  His 
“originality,”  “force,”  “acuteness,”  and  “inventiveness”  have  been 
praised.  John Morely spoke of these things and “above all the quaint 
and whimsical humour of that striking genius.”  Others spoke of his 
“vivid sense of reality and strong impulse to unite theorizing  with 
practical problems.”  His qualities became those of 
The Economist, and its influence grew steadily under his stewardship.</p><p>Bagehot occupied  a position in British financial affairs  similar to 
that which Walter Lippman holds regarding American foreign affairs. 
The  British  Prime  Minister  Gladstone  called  him  “the  permanent 
Chancellor of the Exchequer.”  This title was merited not only by 
his constant commentary on the state of the nation and its  financial 
affairs, but by the singular fact that he invented  the Treasury  Bill. 
In  1877  Sir Stafford Northcote, the then official  Chancellor  of the 
Exchequer, sought Bagehot’s counsel on what might be done to raise 
needed funds in the light of the unpopularity which Exchequer Bills 
were currently facing.  Bagehot at oncc said that what the Treasury 
needed was a security which resembled as closely as possible a com­
mercial bill of exchange.  In other words, it should  be short term, 
highly negotiable and should be sold on a discount basis.  His inven­
tion has been a spectacularly successful one.  Treasury bills are  an 
important instrument of governmental finance in virtually all devel­
oped countries today.</p><p>Lombard Street
 shows the marriage of theorizing and concern with 
problems which is so typical of Bagehot.  The  book  describes  the 
origin and operation of the English money market and the nature of 
the role of the Bank of England in that market.  Its comments on the 
nature of banking and bankers are brilliant and represent the sharing 
of the experience of a sophisticated  man  of  affairs.  But 
Lombard
Street
is also a piece of advocacy.  It urges reform and modification rather  than  reformulation  and  reorganization.  The  advocacy  has 
been successful although the battle was won only over a rather long 
period of time.  It took time to  (as Keynes saw Bagehot’s purpose) 
“knock  two  or  three  fundamental  truths  into  the  heads  of  City 
magnates.”</p><p>The book is easy to read and every budding economist and banker 
should read  it early in  his  career.  The  novice  can  learn  much  in 
seeing the situation out of which Bagehot’s recommendation of proper 
banking  principles  arose.  He  has  the  experience  of watching  the 
growth of banking practices similar to that which the law student re­
ceives in his study of the development of case law.  He acquires a 
kind of institutionalism in his view of economic matters that is hard to 
convey in any other fashion.  This is an exciting view of economics. 
The world is seen as it really is.  The future is found to evolve out 
of  the  past  as  old  institutions  are  progressively  adapted  to  meet 
changing problems.</p><p>Perhaps it was his legal training that gave Bagehot’s writings their 
institutional  overcast  and  influenced  him  to  draw  little  distinction 
between description and theory.  His approach is in many ways simi­
lar to that of Wesley Clair Mitchell.  For both of them economics 
clearly had time and space dimensions.  Bagehot held that one reason 
for the dullness of much political economy was its attempt to be uni­
versal.  Consequently he confined his efforts to problems of the day.</p><p>It may be proper to say that his economics even had personality 
dimensions since 
Lombard Street
 discusses bankers almost as much as 
it does banking.  On this score one feels a twinge of sympathy for Mr. 
Aloxon whose ill-advised actions at the General Court of the Bank of 
England are recorded for posterity in Bagehot’s Appendix.  The inci­
dent there reproduced illustrates the way not to get things done in a 
meeting.  In a Memoir to Bagehot, R. H.  Hutton, his associate for 
many years says, “... Bagehot’s most original writing was due less to 
his deductions from the fundamental axioms of the modem science 
than to that deep insight into men which he had gained in many dif­
ferent fields.”  It is these last mentioned features which the profes­
sional  reader  of 
Lombard  Street savors.  And  thus  we  see  why 
Lombard Street is a classic.  It is absorbing on first reading to the 
young and delightful in the rereading by their elders.</p><p>There is  little  point in  summarizing  here  the  principal  ideas  of 
this pellucid book.  The reader will enjoy the original much better 
than any summation.  However, a brief mention may be made of its 
formal scope.  It explains the origins and operation of British banking and bill trading.  It sets forth the relations that exist between the Bank 
of England, other banks, bill brokers, the Government, and  foreign 
countries.  It also explains the relationships which should exist.  Not 
generally appreciated, in spite of W. W. Rostow’s essay on the matter, 
is Bagehot’s strikingly modem ideas of the nature and functioning of 
the business cycle.  There is  little in  his  description  which  should 
be amended or omitted today, save for its rather heavy emphasis on 
agricultural matters.</p><p>Lombard Street
, written in response to problems of the day, has an 
air of urgency and cogency.  To appreciate it the student of central 
banking needs a brief account of the events which led  Bagehot  to 
write it.</p><p>Bagehot’s world of 1850 was a vastly different place than that of </p><ol><li>The Industrial Revolution had altered the physical landscape of</li></ol><p>the Old World and brought changes in governmental, philosophical, 
and economic thinking.  The New World was asserting a right to its 
own destiny.  Adam Smith had launched the idea that wealth lay in 
store for the nation that let its businessmen fight for gain in untram­
melled markets.  The fight against the  corn  laws  had  been  waged 
and won.</p><p>While Smith  had  expressed doubt  that  the  English  Government 
could safely be entrusted to run a public bank and commented on the 
extravagance of democracies in times of war, it was war which im­
posed the most serious banking and monetary difficulties on the coun­
try and which ultimately set Bagehot to enunciating the way England 
could have good banking.  In any event, by  1850 the time had come 
when institutions had to be changed to meet new circumstances.</p><p>The very long series of Napoleonic Wars beginning in 1792 precip­
itated the monetary troubles which continued through Bagehot’s time. 
The immediate antagonists, France, Austria, and Prussia, were soon 
to be joined by Great Britain, Holland, Spain, and Sardinia.  The next 
twenty-three years of strife were anxious  but opportune  times  for 
Britain’s  banks and  bankers.  Large  sums  were  raised  for  loans  to 
allies, for the expansion of trade in war supplies, and for their pro­
duction.</p><p>By 1795 gold began to rise in price, and with the depreciation of 
English money, foreign supplies became increasingly expensive.  The 
partial failure of the English com crop and the war-stimulated demand 
for food added to this problem.  In 1797, under these strains and be­
cause of runs on English banks, the Restriction Act was passed.  It 
prohibited all banks, including the Bank of England, from paying out gold and silver in return for their notes until six months  after  the 
close  of hostilities.  With  the  country  off a metallic  standard  and 
the restraining effect of the need for specie removed, the number of 
banks in the country rose rapidly, and by 1814 their number had more 
than quadrupled.</p><p>The Restriction Act and the high price of gold produced concern 
and argument among leading figures of the day.  The debate which 
ensued  has  come  to  be  called  the  “Bullionist  Controversy.”  The 
“bullionist” faction argued that the premium on gold had come about 
as a result of excessive note issue.  They urged a return to a metallic 
currency.  The “anti-bullionists,”  among whom was the  Governor 
of the Bank of England, were impressed with the necessity and the 
profitability  of financing the war and supported the Government’s 
act.  In 1809 David Ricardo published a pamphlet entitled 
The High
Price  of  Bullion
, in which  he  more  or  less  allied  himself with  the 
Bullionists.  He held that the high price  of bullion had been occa­
sioned by the overissue of paper money and advocated its gradual re­
duction and a return to convertibility.  The convertibility which he 
sought was not to mean the end of paper money circulation and its 
replacement with coinage, but envisaged the more sophisticated gold 
bullion standard.  Under this standard only substantial sums of notes 
could be converted into gold in the form of bullion or bars.</p><p>The Bullion Committee, a Parliamentary Committee, in its  1810 
report relied heavily upon Ricardo’s thinking.  It advocated  (as did 
a later committee in 1819) a return to convertibility with gold.  (The 
Gold Standard Act of 1816
 had abolished bimetallism in Britain.)  Its 
advice was heeded when, in  1822, cash payments for notes were re­
sumed.  This would have happened earlier save for a depression in 1810 and for Napoleon’s reappearance on the continent in  1815 after 
his escape from Elba.</p><p>The ideas that persisted from this controversy were that in order 
to assure sound banking the note issue must be tied firmly down, and 
that it must be very directly related to the size of the Bank of Eng­
land’s gold stock.  The adoption of these views in the Charter Act of 1844 was the immediate cause of Bagehot’s concern in 
Lombard Street</p><p>But other developments also help explain the nature of the  1844 
Charter Act.  With the cessation of war finance  a period  of bank 
failures was ushered in, and of the now enlarged number of banks, 240 ceased payment in 1814-16.  The resumption of payment in specie 
by no means helped alleviate this troubled  financial  picture,  for in 1825, in another wave of bank failures, 70 more banks closed.  The British government in 1826 sought to deal with this pattern of depres­
sion and bank failures by allowing joint-stock banks to issue notes 
outside of a 65-mile radius of London.  This privilege, long held by 
private banks, was extended to the joint-stock banks in the belief that 
these larger banks would be better able to remain solvent and to stave 
off bank runs.  Since this act ended the monopoly of the  Bank  of 
England, alone among joint-stock banks, to issue notes, the bank re­
acted to this new competition by  establishing branches in principal 
cities.  This development fortuitously tended to case the burden  of 
transferring funds within the country and thus added to the security 
of the banking system.</p><p>In  1833  joint-stock banks  were  allowed  to  open  in  London,  al­
though the exclusive note-issuing power of the Bank of England was 
not further weakened.  With these legal changes there was a great 
growth of joint-stock banks, over  100 being established, to the dis­
advantage  of  the  private  banks,  by  1836.  With  the  expansion  of 
deposit banking, especially in London’s metropolitan area, the use of 
checks became much more important.  But the liberalization of the 
law  regarding  note  issuing  by  joint  stock,  and  thus  presumably 
sounder banks,  itself led to speculation.  It was soon  demonstrated 
that even joint-stock banks could overissue notes,  for bank  failures 
continued.</p><p>The series of bank failures in  1837, 1839, and  1842 clearlv demon­
strated that the changes that had been made had not sufficed, and that 
the problem of achieving a sound monetary and banking system still 
remained.  Fresh  controversies  arose  as  to  a  way  out  of the  diffi­
culties.  The “Currency School” held that what was needed to remedy 
all ills was the 100 per cent backing of all currency with gold.  The 
opposing “Banking” view was that a fractional gold  reserve would 
suffice.</p><p>In  1844 Sir Robert Peel seized the opportunity presented by the 
necessity of periodical re-enactment of the Bank of England’s charter 
and combined these views.  The new Charter Act provided that the 
Bank of England could issue notes in the amount of 
£14 million se­cured by government securities, and  that any  note  issue above this 
amount was to be 100 per cent backed with gold or silver.  Silver was 
not to cover over one fifth of this amount.  Notes were to be payable 
in gold coin.  A buying and selling range for gold was announced.  No 
new banks were to be given the privilege of issuing notes, and those al­
ready possessing the privilege were limited as to the absolute amounts 
they could issue.  The amounts were set at the average note issue outstanding during the three months prior to the introduction of the bill. 
When a private bank ceased payment, acquired more than six part­
ners, became a joint-stock bank, or amalgamated with another bank, 
it lost all right to  issue  notes.  The  Bank  of England  then  would 
acquire the right to issue up to two thirds of the lapsed issue.  The 
Bank of England was also thenceforth required to publish in the press 
weekly accounts of its final position.  The Act provided the basis for 
the peculiar form of the Bank of England Accounts, namely a division 
of its activities under a note-issuing department and a banking depart­
ment.  This division also served as a basis for apportioning the earnings 
of the bank betw een the government and the proprietors.  The form 
of the  accounts  even  today  is  unchanged,  although  the  bank  was 
nationalized and the proprietors compensated for their loss of owner­
ship in 1946.</p><p>Lombard Street
 stands as a testimony that this Act of 1844 proved 
no  panacea.  The  Act  represented  a  triumph  of  the  “Currency 
School” over the “Banking School.”  The Currency School’s think­
ing closely resembled that of the early bullionists.  They had great 
faith in the money metal and saw notes as mere receipts for it.  They 
were concerned with keeping the exchange rate stable, and they felt 
that sufficient gold backing and restraint of the note  issue were all 
that were needed to assure a sound  monetary  and  banking system. 
The later doctrine of the workings of the automatic gold standard 
with its consequences of variable domestic note issue is a continua­
tion of their position. </p><p>Bagehot and his predecessor on the 
Economist
, James Wilson, rep­
resented  the  banking  school.  They  were  painfully  aware  of  the 
fact that a hamstrung note  issuer could  get  into  serious  difficulties 
and  thus  cause  hardship  to  the  whole  economy  as  well  as  to  the 
banking community.  They saw that what was involved in the man­
agement of the Nation’s money and  needed watching, was not the 
mere size of the note issue, but the entire size  of the credit system 
as it functioned through the banks, bill brokers, and security dealers. 
They saw deposits as money, especially those created in the financing 
of bills  of exchange which, quite  as  much  as  notes,  required  Bank 
of England support.  Bagehot would have preferred to trust prudent 
banking management rather than  some  arbitrary  limit  to  note  and 
credit creation, which indeed in times of crises might need to be sus­
pended.  He  also  felt  that  prudence  dictated  larger  gold  reserves 
than the Bank was in the habit of maintaining.  But then this story 
should be left to be told by Bagehot himself.</p><h2>Advertisement</h2><p>The composition
of this little book has occupied a much longer time 
than, perhaps, my readers may think its length or its importance de­
serves.  It was begun as long ago as the autumn of  1870; and though 
its progress  has  been  often suspended  by  pressing  occupations  and 
imperfect health,  I  have never ceased to work  at  it  when  I  could. 
But I fear that  in consequence, in some casual illustrations at least, 
every part of the book may not seem, as the lawyers would say, *to 
speak from the same time.’  The figures and the examples which it is 
most natural to use at one time are not quite those which it is most 
natural to use at another; and a slowly written book on a living and 
changing subject is apt a little to want unity in this respect.</p><p>I fear that I must not expect a very favourable reception for this 
work.  It speaks mainly of four sets of persons—the Bank of England, 
Joint Stock Banks other than  that Bank,  private  bankers,  and  bill- 
brokers; and I am much afraid that neither will altogether like what 
is said of them.  I can only say that the opinions now expressed have 
not been formed hastily or at a distance from the facts; that, on the 
contrary, they have been slowly matured in ‘Lombard Street’ itself, 
and that, perhaps, as they will not be altogether pleasing to anyone, 
I  may  at  least  ask  for  the  credit  of  having  been  impartial  in  my 
criticism.</p><p>I should also say that I am indebted to a friend for the correction 
of the final proof sheets, which an attack of illness prevented me from 
fully revising.  If it had not been for his kind assistance, the publica­
tion of the book must have  been postponed  till the  autumn, which, 
as  its  production  has  already  been  so  slow,  would  have  been  very 
annoying to me.</p><em>Walter Bagehot</em></div></div></div>
